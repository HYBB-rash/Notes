## 正文

​	Hello, my name is Hyong, a common student studying in the computer science college in the Shanghai University of Electric Power. Today I want to chat about my hometown.

​	Actually, my real homeland is Boluo in the Guangdong province. It’s is undeniable that Boluo is so attractive, but I want to talk about Foshan in Guangdong. The reason that I choose to Foshan is I grew up in this. Compare to Boluo,  I have more love in Foshan. 

​	Foshan is very famous in China! Even if you feel you have never heard about Foshan, you have probably heard of Foshan Wuying Feet! Not only this, but also Wing Chun! Not long ago,  ‘Ye Wen 4’ have spread all over the world, and received warm welcome. Cool! It have made me passionate with every punch of Donnie Yen.

​	Of course, there many pictures of Foshan charm culture, such as tea, Lion dance, Morning tea, Herbal tea and many other. Today I just want to chat the tip of the  iceberg, Wing Chun.

​	I want to chat something will make you feel amazed. ‘Cun jing’ , a important skill in this Boxing. Could you imagine that you are hit away by a fist only a few centimeters away? This is a special skill in Wing Chun. You can find some videos to learn more about it. You must have been amazing by its power.

​	If you are interested in Foshan, welcome to visit me in Foshan. Although I cannot use Kung fu to show you, you will fall in love in Foshan.
